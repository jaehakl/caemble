In order to solve and analyse these fluid flows we require intensive simulation involving mathematical equations which governs the fluid flow, these are Navier Stokes (NS) equation. Solving these equations has become a necessity as almost every problem which is related to fluid flow analysis call for solving of Navier Stokes equation. These NS equations are partial differential equations so different numerical methods are used to solve these equations. Solving these partial differential equations so different numerical methods requires large amount of computing power and huge amount of memory is in play. Only practical feasible way to solve these equation is write a parallel program to solve them, which can then be run on powerful hardware capable of parallel processing to get the desired results High speed supercomputer will provide us very good performance in terms of reduction in execution time.

ayazhassan/RT-CUDA-GUI-Development,https://github.com/ayazhassan/RT-CUDA-GUI-Development,"Recent development in Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) has opened a new challenge in harnessing their computing power as a new general-purpose computing paradigm with its CUDA parallel programming. However, porting applications to CUDA remains a challenge to average programmers. We have developed a restructuring software compiler (RT-CUDA) with best possible kernel optimizations to bridge the gap between high-level languages and the machine dependent CUDA environment. RT-CUDA is based upon a set of compiler optimizations. RT-CUDA takes a C-like program and convert it into an optimized CUDA kernel with user directives in a con.figuration .file for guiding the compiler. While the invocation of external libraries is not possible with OpenACC commercial compiler, RT-CUDA allows transparent invocation of the most optimized external math libraries like cuSparse and cuBLAS. For this, RT-CUDA uses interfacing APIs, error handling interpretation, and user transparent programming. This enables efficient design of linear algebra solvers (LAS). Evaluation of RT-CUDA has been performed on Tesla K20c GPU with a variety of basic linear algebra operators (M+, MM, MV, VV, etc.) as well as the programming of solvers of systems of linear equations like Jacobi and Conjugate Gradient. We obtained significant speedup over other compilers like OpenACC and GPGPU compilers. RT-CUDA facilitates the design of efficient parallel software for developing parallel simulators (reservoir simulators, molecular dynamics, etc.) which are critical for Oil & Gas industry. We expect RT-CUDA to be needed by many industries dealing with science and engineering simulation on massively parallel computers like NVIDIA GPUs.",2026-02-18T15:57:54Z,2026-02-19T05:04:57Z,"{""domain"": [""gas"", ""molecular-dynamics""], ""intent"": [""simulation"", ""simulator"", ""solver""], ""hpc"": [""cuda"", ""gpu""]}",C,8,1,1,2025-09-20T23:00:17Z,MIT,"[""antlr"", ""c"", ""compiler"", ""cuda"", ""nvidia-cuda"", ""nvidia-gpu"", ""source-to-source"", ""translator""]"

softmaterialslab/np-shape-lab,https://github.com/softmaterialslab/np-shape-lab,"The shape of nanoparticles determines their ability to interact with biological systems in nanomedicine applications. This framework simulates the shape deformation of deformable patchy nanoparticles for a broad variety of nanoparticle material properties and solution conditions. Molecular dynamics based simulated annealing is used to minimize the energy of the nanoparticle for a given set of material and solution parameters. Users can input control parameters such as the maximum surface charge, surface patch size, stretching modulus, and bending modulus, as well as control the solution ionic strength (salt concentration) changing the electrostatic drive to deform. Changing patch size parameter tunes the surface charge from a small value close to 0 to the maximum surface charge selected by the user. Suggested values of patch size are 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9 to observe a wide range of shape transitions. After running the simulation, in various output tabs, users can view the snapshots of the nanoparticle shape at various stages of the energy minimization process. Plots of the minimization of the electrostatic energy and increase in the area of the nanoparticle are also available (both these quantities are normalized by the associated values of the initial spherical conformation). Volume of the nanoparticle is conserved, representative of a finite amount of cargo.  The range of charge, elasticities, and salt concentrations enable users to observe deformation into varios equilibrium shapes including bowls, hemispheres, discs, and rods, and egg-like conformations.  The app is ran using hybrid MPI/OMP parallelized C++ codes and Python post-processing and app deployment. After the simulation, the following data files can be downloaded: final image of the shape of the container (PNG), movie of the entire deformation process (LAMMPS output format for viewing in Ovito or VMD), raw area data (in units of the radius of the sphere), and raw energy data including electrostatic energy variation with time (in kB T).",2026-02-18T15:59:04Z,2026-02-18T16:36:54Z,"{""domain"": [""elasticity"", ""molecular-dynamics""], ""intent"": [""simulation""], ""hpc"": [""mpi""]}",Mathematica,2,8,7,2025-03-10T17:11:19Z,BSD-3-Clause,"[""simulation-framework""]"
SomajitDey/progrep,https://github.com/SomajitDey/progrep,"progrep is a command-line tool (Linux) to show live progress report, status and stats of a running simulation or compute job that executes a given number of iterations. It shows % completed, time remaining(ETA), time elapsed (both wall-clock & CPU time), number of threads, MPI_Rank(if any), CPU usage & speed (FPS). The FPS measures may be used in benchmarking, for example, while optimizing HPC algorithms for performance. progrep supports both serial (single-core/single-threaded) and parallel (multicore and/or multinode - e.g. OpenMP and/or MPI) jobs. progrep can also report for jobs running on remote hosts [Case in point: jobs running on Linux Clusters]. progrep works in client-server model. The server for progrep can be installed in your simulation source code with only 4 extra lines (API). When the progrep command is invoked, it queries this server as a client. progrep does not interfere with or slow down your simulation when not invoked. Even when invoked, the overhead is insignificant. Out of the box, the progrep API works with code written in Fortran, C and C++.

Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons,https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]  Decision trees Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.  Support vector machines Main article: Support vector machines Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.[69] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.   Illustration of linear regression on a data set. Regression analysis Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.  Bayesian networks Main article: Bayesian network  A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.  Genetic algorithms Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[73]  Training models Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.  Federated learning Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[74]  Applications There are many applications for machine learning, including:  Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[75] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[81]  Limitations Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[85]  In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[87][88]  Bias Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[89] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[90][91] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[92][93] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[94] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[95] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[96] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[97] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[98] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There’s nothing artificial about AI...It’s inspired by people, it’s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.”[99]  Model assessments Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[100]  In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).[101]  Ethics Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[102] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[103][104] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.  Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[105][106]  Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.[107]  Hardware Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.[108] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[109] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[110][111]  Software Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:  Free and open-source so",2026-02-18T16:14:51Z,2026-02-19T05:34:19Z,"{""domain"": [""collision"", ""robot"", ""structural""], ""intent"": [""engine"", ""examples"", ""solver""], ""method"": [""artificial-intelligence"", ""bayesian"", ""deep-neural-networks"", ""genetic-algorithm""]}",,78,18,2,2026-02-12T01:53:20Z,,"[""an-ann"", ""android"", ""artificial-intelligence"", ""aryia-behroziuan"", ""bootstrap"", ""csharp"", ""deep-learning"", ""expressjs"", ""firebase"", ""neural-network"", ""wikipedia""]"

The necessary finite element method calculations were performed by using ANSYS APDL and the results are post-processed in ParaView to visualize the load paths. The load paths are visualized for 2D and 3D structural problems. The influence of boundary conditions, types of loading, mesh elements and mesh sensitivity analysis were studied.

alansoong200/SSSR_PET,https://github.com/alansoong200/SSSR_PET,"The intrinsically low spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) leads to image quality degradation and inaccurate image-based quantitation. Recently developed supervised super-resolution (SR) approaches are of great relevance to PET but require paired low- and high-resolution images for training, which are usually unavailable for clinical datasets. In this paper, we present a self-supervised SR (SSSR) technique for PET based on dual generative adversarial networks (GANs), which precludes the need for paired training data, ensuring wider applicability and adoptability. The SSSR network receives as inputs a low-resolution PET image, a high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) image, spatial information (axial and radial coordinates), and a high-dimensional feature set extracted from an auxiliary CNN which is separately-trained in a supervised manner using paired simulation datasets. The network is trained using a loss function which includes two adversarial loss terms, a cycle consistency term, and a total variation penalty on the SR image. We validate the SSSR technique using a clinical neuroimaging dataset. We demonstrate that SSSR is promising in terms of image quality, peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, contrast-to-noise ratio, and an additional no-reference metric developed specifically for SR image quality assessment. Comparisons with other SSSR variants suggest that its high performance is largely attributable to simulation guidance.",2026-02-18T16:17:53Z,2026-02-18T16:17:53Z,"{""domain"": [""structural""], ""intent"": [""simulation""]}",Jupyter Notebook,10,3,0,2025-12-13T09:15:02Z,,"[""gan"", ""super-resolution""]"

The dataframe it returns consists of 'n' observations per rep, 'rep' number of reps and is grouped by rep. Any aggregate operations you perform such as df['column'].mean().compute() or df['column'].std().compute() will run in parallel by default and give you an pandas series consisting of the means of each sample replicate. You can do most anything on this that you can with a Pandas DataFrame that is grouped by the same column. You just have to add the .compute() method to your method call, because this runs on futures parallelization. See the excerpts in the examples.

A graphical user interface using the graphical user interface development environment (GUIDE) of MATLAB was created to implement the ICM&M method for the ECPL process. The software interfaces with the hardware of the ECPL system’s ultraviolet lamp and DMD, and the ICM&M system’s camera. It was designed to streamline the operation of the ECPL process with the aid of parallel computing that implements online both the ICM&M acquisition and measurement analysis as well as the feedback control method. The application logs the acquired interferogram video data, performs numerical computations for the ICM&M measurement algorithms and control law, saves the real-time data and measurement results for all voxels in the region of interest. Meanwhile, it displays interferogram frames and visualize the photocuring process without a substantial sacrifice in temporal performance of other key functions such as data acquisition and measurement & control analysis. The software could be extended to real-time process measurement and control for other additive manufacturing systems, for example, metal based additive manufacturing aided by in-situ thermal images analysis.",2026-02-18T16:31:27Z,2026-02-18T16:31:27Z,"{""domain"": [""thermal""], ""intent"": [""examples""]}",Matlab,14,4,0,2025-12-31T00:22:06Z,MIT,"[""3d-printing"", ""additive-manufacturing"", ""camera"", ""data-logging"", ""data-visualization"", ""feedback-controller"", ""image-acquisition"", ""in-situ"", ""instrument-control"", ""interferometry"", ""lithography"", ""photopolymerization"", ""process-measurement"", ""process-monitoring"", ""real-time-video-streaming""]"

大陆修宪香港恶法台湾武统朝鲜毁约美中冷战等都是王沪宁愚弄习思想极左命运共同体的大策划中共窃国这半个多世纪所犯下的滔天罪恶，前期是毛泽东策划的，中期6.4前后是邓小平策划的，黄牛数据分析后期是毛的极左追随者三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁策划的。王沪宁高小肆业因文革政治和情报需要保送“学院外语班“红色仕途翻身，所以王的本质是极左的。他是在上海底层弄堂长大的，因其本性也促成其瘪三下三滥个性，所以也都说他有易主“变色龙”哈巴狗“的天性。大陆像王沪宁这样学马列政治所谓""法学""专业的人，在除朝鲜古巴所有国家特别是在文明发达国家是无法找到专业对口工作必定失业，唯独在大陆却是重用的紧缺“人才”，6.4后中共信仰大危机更是最重用的救党“人才”。这也就是像王沪宁此类工农兵假“大学生”平步青云的原因，他们最熟悉毛泽东历次运动的宫庭内斗经验手段和残酷的阶级斗争等暴力恐怖的“政治学”。王沪宁能平步青云靠他这马毛伪“政治学”资本和头衔，不是什么真才实学，能干实事有点真才实学的或许在他手下的谋士及秘书班子中可以找到。王沪宁的“真才实学”只不过是一个只读四年小学的人，大半辈子在社会上磨炼特别是在中共官场滚打炼出的的手段和经验而已，他和习近平等保送的工农兵假“大学生”都一样，无法从事原“专业”都凭红资本而从政。六四学运期间各界一边倒支持学生，王沪宁一度去法国躲避和筹谋，他还加入了反学运签名，成为极少有的反学运者仕途突显，在六四和苏联垮台后中共意识形态危机，江泽民上台看上唯一能应急的王沪宁聚谋士泡制的""稳定统一领导""和之后的""新权威""谬论。左转被邓小平南巡阻止后，王策划顺邓经济改革却将政治改革逐步全面终止和倒退，泡制“三个代表”为极左转建立庞大牢固的红色既得利益集团。因此六四后各重大决策和危机难题都摆在中共中央政策研究室王沪宁桌面上，使王沪宁成了此后中共三朝都无法摆脱的幕后最有决策性实权的人，中共中央政策研究室是王为其野心巨资经营几十年，聚众谋士的间谍情报汇总研究的特务机关和策划制定决策重要机构与基地，王沪宁本人和决定其仕途关键的首任岳父及家属就有情报工作背景。中央政研室重要到王沪宁入常后为了死抓这中共情报与决策大权，宁可放弃国家副主席和中央党校校长。后再加个除习外唯他担任的中共几核心领导小组之一的“不忘初心牢记使命”主题教育工作小组组长。此后他把持的舆论必将以宣传“不忘初心牢记使命”为主，打造众所周知的所谓“习思想”其实是”王思想“。王自从主导中央政研室开始决策后，策划中止邓小平的与美妥协路线回归毛极左的反美路线。帮助前南斯拉夫提供情报打落美机放中使馆引发炸使馆事件，以此掀起六四后唯一的全国大规模游行并借此反美而起家。后又帮江泽民提供法轮功会是超过中共组织的情报，策划决策镇压迫害开始并没有把矛头指向江的法轮功群体，策划决定阻止党内外近三十年来平反六四的呼声。致远黑皮书马拉松程序员易支付英语台词文字匹配美团点评各业务线提供知识库团队共享阿里云高精Excel识别德讯

The simulation begins as a 9-bus system with existing generation (3 generators) and transmission lines (8 lines). System topology can be viewed in a figure throughout the game with the yearly generation and load at each bus. In addition, dynamic color-coding is used to highlight transmission lines that exceed MVA ratings and highlight bus voltages that violate any limits. The winning objective of the player company (you) is to maximize his profit. Reliability can be tracked by viewing the N-1 generator and line contingencies every year, but this does not influence profits. There are two generation technologies used: coal and gas turbine. Each technology will have a similar competitor in the simulation. The competitor can bring down the market price and reduce the player’s profits significantly. The clock starts at T=0 in the investment game with a historical record of past prices and projected prices based on lack of investment. As time moves forward in yearly increments, the load, prices, investment costs, and other variables are adjusted to that of the player’s performance. The player has the opportunity to study various profitable and unprofitable investment alternatives each year of the simulation. If he invests at the right location, and in the right planning year, his company can make windfall profits. Competitors randomly participate in adding extra generation in random areas of the system based on the competition level settings. The challenge for the user is to study the effects of his investment decisions on market prices, reliability, and his profitability.

Devising a way to sample more experience points close to the tricky areas would help solving this problem, better the training rate and improve convergence. We designed a game environment for the Android platform as few such environments are available at the moment. Moreover, during the pre-processing game we removed the background and score to reduce clutter and increase likeliness of successful training. It would be interesting to see how restoring the background affects agent’s performance.

It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Long Short Term Memories(LSTMs) can solve numerous tasks not solvable by previous learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDS's (intrusion detection systems). LSTMs can also be efficiently applied for time-series predictions.

The proposed approach is based on the simultaneous utilization of powerful and new multi-objective optimization techniques along with a circuit simulator under a data link. The proposed optimizing tool creates a perfect tradeoff between the contradictory objective functions in CMOS RO optimal design. This tool is applied for intelligent estimation of the circuit parameters (channel width of transistors), which have a decisive influence on RO specifications.  Along the optimal RO design in an specified range of oscillaton frequency, the Power Consumption, Phase Noise,  Figure of Merit (FoM), Integration Index, Design Cycle Time are considered as objective functions. Also, in generation of Pareto front some important issues, i.e. Overall Nondominated Vector Generation (ONVG), and Spacing (S) are considered for more effectiveness of the obtained feasible solutions in application. Four optimization algorithms called Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), Multi-Objective Inclined Planes system Optimization (MOIPO), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Multi-Objective Modified Inclined Planes System Optimization (MOMIPO) are utilized for 0.18-mm CMOS technology with supply voltage of 1-V.
